    <details>
      <summary>about:blanker</summary>
      <p>
        A standard of disguising, the about:blanker opens a new about:blank window with a iframe containing the website. Simple to create, simple to use, and usually quite effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method is easy to do - just drag the link below to your bookmarks bar!
      </p>
      <h4><a href="javascript:alert('It seems that the about:blanker didn\'t load on the website correctly. Go back and try again.')" id="blanker">Clockmod</a></h4>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Save as .html</summary>
      <p>
        A common disguise method, save a file on your Chromebook, then open it. Just an HTML file with an iframe.

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Save as .htm</summary>
